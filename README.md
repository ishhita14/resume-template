# resume-template
A cool and responsive template for Resume that can be used for professional purposes. It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project focuses on creating a dynamic and responsive resume template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to showcase their education, portfolio, work experience, and other relevant details in an appealing and professional manner. It has multiple sections for each aspect of a resume, like an about section for self-description, animated skills section using javascript, experience and education sections with elements that are designed to appear as moving but are actually static, and a portfolio section for you to display your best works. It also has Contact section which includes address and phone number for following up. 
This project is my attempt to showcase my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while providing users with a valuable tool to create professional resumes that effectively highlight their qualifications and experiences.

Hope you like it, Happy Coding!
